# ChromTech Series III LabVIEW Drivers

These drivers can be used to help LabVIEW software communicate with a 
ChromTech Series III pump.

## Installation

1. Download the latest `.vip` installer from the [Releases page](https://github.com/RxnRover/driver_chromtech_series_iii/releases).  
2. Double-click the downloaded `.vip` file to install it with VIPM.
3. Ensure you have also installed the subsequent  [Plugin](https://github.com/RxnRover/plugin_chromtech_series_iii_pump/releases).  

### Manual Installation (optional)

Download the library by clicking the "Code" button and selecting "Download 
ZIP". Extract the ZIP file into your `<labview>/instr.lib/` directory, where 
`<labview>` is the location of your LabVIEW installation. `instr.lib` is where 
instrument drivers are placed so they can be found by other LabVIEW projects.
